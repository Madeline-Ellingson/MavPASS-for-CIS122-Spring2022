Go To MavPASS_1-19_FirstQuiz zip folder. Download and extract it into your 
Visual Studio repos folder.

Here is an expample path to the visual studio repos folder which should be very similar 
to what you would see in your file explorer.

C:\Users\beard\source\repos

Instead of beard it would probably be your name or whatever user you are on your
PC

Quiz Prompt:

// - Create an array of integers
// - Make a method ElimminateDuplicates that takes in an array
// and gets rid of any duplicate numbers
// - Create a method RemoveHigher that takes in an array
// and removes any number that is not lower than the one before it

Go To CIS122_1_19_2022 zip folder. Download and extract it into your 
Visual Studio repos folder.
